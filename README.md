# Python Speedrun Autosplitter
A python script for SikuliX to automate splitting in speedruns based on image recognition.

## Setup
1. Get the latest version of SikuliX from [the SikuliX website](http://sikulix.com/)
2. Put the jar installer into a newly created folder and run it
3. When being asked, choose *Pack 1* and *Python (Jython)* as the scripting language
4. Insert the *autosplitter.sikuli* folder into the SikuliX root folder
5. Start *sikulix.jar* and open the *autosplitter.sikuli* project

## Usage
1. To set everything up, start the script once from the SikuliX IDE **(and don't start it from the SikuliX IDE again after that)**
2. To start the script in the future, use the newly created autosplitter_start.cmd in your SikuliX root folder
3. Configure the script to your liking using the SikuliX IDE

## Troubleshooting
* If for any reason you started the script via the SikuliX IDE, you can stop execution with *Alt+Shift+C*
